# neiss
This project's simple aim is to clean and move the annual NEISS data tables from http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/ into a centralized database

These files deal with the main data table, which is the bulk of the data:

  merge_txt_files.py: this file takes the annual .tsv files (generated by MSFT) and merges them into one large file to import into 
    MS Access

  import-tsv-pg.py: this is the first cut at moving each annual .tsv file into postgres
  
  import.py: this corrects some minor issues of above (using porper datetime, correcting quotes, etc) 

  the import files are not very efficient code wise, plan to develop more automated code for side tables (side tables list names
    associated with codes in main NEISS table columns)
